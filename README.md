# serial_parser_storage
Backend for my first half capstone project...

## Project Vision

This will be a small command-line app with a SQLite back-end that serves up and stores parsed serial data from a midi-controller...

Users will be able to record input, store-it, and call upon it either live or from storage for visualization.

The purpose of this will be for education and analyzation of data.
